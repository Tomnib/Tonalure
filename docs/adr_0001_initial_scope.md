# ADR 0001: Initial Scope and Project Definition

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I am building an AI-powered music analysis and recommendation platform focused on spectrogram-based audio insights. This ADR documents the core functionality and architecture assumptions.

## Decision
I will use:
- AWS S3 to store audio files and spectrograms
- AWS Lambda for backend logic
- SageMaker for model training/inference
- DynamoDB for lightweight structured data
- API Gateway + React for user interaction

## Consequences
- Highly serverless architecture
- Tightly coupled to AWS Services (Initially acceptable)
- SageMaker model design will need to support continuous improvment.
